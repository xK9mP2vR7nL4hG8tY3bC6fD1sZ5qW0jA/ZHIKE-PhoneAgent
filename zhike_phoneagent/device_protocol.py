"""Device Protocol - Abstract interface for device operations.

This module defines the protocol (interface) that all device implementations
must follow. The actual implementation can be:
- ADB (local subprocess calls)
- Accessibility Service
- Remote HTTP/gRPC calls
- Mock (for testing)

Example:
    >>> from zhike_phoneagent.devices import ADBDevice, MockDevice
    >>>
    >>> # Production: use ADB
    >>> device = ADBDevice("emulator-5554")
    >>> screenshot = device.get_screenshot()
    >>> device.tap(100, 200)
    >>>
    >>> # Testing: use Mock with state machine
    >>> mock = MockDevice("mock_001", state_machine)
    >>> screenshot = mock.get_screenshot()  # Returns state machine's screenshot
